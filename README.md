# Trash Buddy 2.0

## What is Trash Buddy?

Our mobile app uses gamification to incentivize users to dispose of recyclables in the correct manner. Our app can scan recyclables to determine if they are recyclable and can assist users in determining the nearest recycling bin from them through visualization on a  google map. We make use of leaderboards and scoreboards in order to pit players against each other.

## How we build it

The entire skeleton of the app was made using Flutter - an open source UI development kit for mobile applications. 

## Challenges we ran into

The first challenge that we ran into is learning a new language, DART. However, as most of us had experience with Javascript, it was rather quick to pick up DART given the similarities in the syntax of DART with Javascript. 

Our next challenge was implementing graphics in Flutter. As we were not familiar with the use of flutter, it was difficult to get sprite packages to work on Flutter. However, we eventually played around more with Flutter and learned how to implement graphics packages on Flutter. 


## What we learned

The biggest takeaway from the hackathon is learning a new language to implement Flutter (DART). This was definitely a really big takeaway, because flutter is a widely-known and useful app for mobile application development, hence, learning DART was very essential.
